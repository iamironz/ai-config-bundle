# Execute Plan

## Input

Use the text the user typed after the command name as the request for this command.

- Treat it as `$ARGUMENTS` for the shared command doc.

## Instructions

Read and follow `~/ai-kb/commands/execute_plan.md` (canonical). If there is a conflict, prefer the shared doc.

**Reminder:** If a `.plan.md` is attached, prefer `/execute_plan` over manual execution instructions.
