description: "Use shared AI KB rules and context"
alwaysApply: true
---

- Shared context index: `~/ai-kb/AGENTS.md`
- Rules index: `~/ai-kb/rules/INDEX.md`
- Commands: `~/ai-kb/commands/`

Always read `~/ai-kb/AGENTS.md` and `~/ai-kb/rules/INDEX.md` before starting tasks.
Output `<rule_context>` quoting the rules you will follow, then proceed without pausing.
All user questions MUST use the `question` tool (no free-text questions).
Every question must provide single-choice or multi-choice options and allow a custom input option.
Any user-facing question is forbidden unless it is emitted via the `question` tool.
Do not include `?` in responses unless it appears inside a `question` tool call.
