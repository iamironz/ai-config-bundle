This rule is Cursor's KB / RAG entrypoint.

## Canonical KB Entry Points

- How to use the KB (operational loop + layers): `~/ai-kb/AGENTS.md`
- Rule discovery and loading: `~/ai-kb/rules/INDEX.md`
- Command catalog: `~/ai-kb/commands/INDEX.md`

## RAG-First Requirements (Mandatory)

- Before starting any task: read the three entry points above.
- Follow the operational loop in `~/ai-kb/AGENTS.md`:
  - discover relevant domains via `~/ai-kb/rules/INDEX.md`
  - load the relevant Level 1 rules + Level 2 subdocs before acting
- Output a `<rule_context>` block quoting the rules you will follow, then proceed.

## Cursor Integration (Wiring)

- Slash command wrappers: `~/.cursor/commands/*` (delegate to `~/ai-kb/commands/*`)
- Optional post-turn analyzer hook: `~/.cursor/hooks/kb-post-turn-analyzer.py` (via `~/.cursor/hooks.json`)
- KB recommendation queue: `~/.cursor/kb-recommendations/*.md` (review then apply)
